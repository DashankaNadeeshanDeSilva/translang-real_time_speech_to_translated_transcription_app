## 💡 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Quick Conversation
```
Speaker: "Hallo!"
Pause: 1 second
Expected: Green box immediately

Speaker: "Wie heißt du?"
Pause: 1 second
Expected: New green box

Speaker: "Ich heiße Max"
Pause: 1 second
Expected: New green box

Result: Should have 3 large, easy-to-read green boxes
```

### Scenario 2: Long Narrative
```
Speaker: "Gestern bin ich in die Stadt gegangen und habe viele interessante Dinge gesehen. Es gab einen schönen Park mit vielen Blumen und ich habe dort eine Weile gesessen und gelesen."

Expected: 
- Long blue text appears (easy to read despite length)
- Eventually finalizes to green
- Text wraps nicely within large box
```

### Scenario 3: VAD Disabled
```
1. Toggle VAD to OFF
2. Start translation
3. Speak with pauses
4. Expected: Only Soniox's natural endpoint detection
5. May wait longer for finalization
```

## 🐛 Known Non-Issues

### Expected Behavior (Not Bugs):
- ✅ Blue text updates frequently (this is live translation!)
- ✅ Text may change before finalizing (non-final tokens)
- ✅ Some latency (100-500ms) is normal
- ✅ Connection takes 1-2 seconds to establish
- ✅ Console shows lots of logs (for debugging)

### Limitations (By Design):
- ⏸️ VAD settings locked during recording (change before start)
- 📝 No transcript export yet (Phase 6)
- 🔄 No reconnection logic yet (Phase 4 - paused for testing)
- 🎨 Inline styles (Phase 5 will use shadcn)

## 📞 Quick Help

**Can't see translations?**
- Check console (F12) for errors
- Verify `.env.local` has `SONIOX_SECRET_KEY`
- Restart dev server after env changes

**Text too small still?**
- Let me know! We can make it even larger
- Current: 22px, can go up to 28px+ if needed

**VAD not working?**
- Check it's toggled ON
- Try adjusting threshold
- Watch console for VAD logs

**Status:** ✅ Phases 0-3 Complete + Large UI
**Ready for:** Testing and Feedback
**Next:** Phase 4 (reconnection) or Phase 5 (UI polish) - your choice!

Enjoy testing the large, readable interface! 🎉
